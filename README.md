# CAN_HS-LS_GW
CAN High Speed (500kbps) to Low Speed Gateway(125kbps)

Project Outline - 
There are three development boards acting as a CAN node on CAN network
1.STM32F4 Discovery (Gateway - 500kbps and 125kbps)
2.STM32 Nucleo (125kbps)
3.AOAA Kit (500kbps)

Some sensors are connected on each node.
